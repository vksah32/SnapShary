# SyncOn

Under development

Have u ever gone on outings with friends where everyone had some snaps of the trip but forgot to sync with each other? This app solves that problem
. You do not even have to connected. Using Wifi-Direct technology, this app helps to sync those pictures offline. So no matter who takes
the pictures, everyone is going to have them eventually.
